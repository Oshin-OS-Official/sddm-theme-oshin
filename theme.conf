MainColor="#F8F8F2"
## Used for all elements when not focused/hovered etc. Usually the best effect is achieved by having this be either white or a very dark grey like #444 (not black for smoother antialias)
## Colors can be HEX or Qt names (e.g. red/salmon/blanchedalmond). See https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-color.html

AccentColor="#343746"
## Used for elements in focus/hover/pressed. Should be contrasting to the background and the MainColor to achieve the best effect.

BackgroundColor="#21222C"
## Used for the user and session selection background as well as for ScreenPadding and FormBackground when either is true. If PartialBlur and FormBackground are both enabled this color will blend with the blur effect.

placeholderColor="#bbbbbb"
## Placholder text color. Example: username, password.

IconColor="#ffffff"
## System icon colors

OverrideLoginButtonTextColor=""
## The text of the login button may become difficult to read depending on your color choices. Use this option to set it independently for legibility.

InterfaceShadowSize="6"
## Integer used as multiplier. Size of the shadow behind the user and session selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background. Initial render can be slow no values above 5-7.

InterfaceShadowOpacity="0.6"
## Double between 0 and 1. Alpha channel of the shadow behind the user and session selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background.

RoundCorners="20"
## Integer in pixels. Radius of the input fields and the login button. Empty for square. Can cause bad antialiasing of the fields.

ScreenPadding="0"
## Integer in pixels. Increase or delete this to have a padding of color BackgroundColor all around your screen. This makes your login greeter appear as if it was a canvas. Cool!

Font="Open Sans"

FontSize=""
